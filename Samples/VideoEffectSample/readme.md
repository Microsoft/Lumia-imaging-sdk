VideoEffectSample
---------------------

This sample demonstrates  how to add **Lumia Imaging Effects** to the stream captured by the using the Windows.Media.Capture API. The effects are added both when previewing, recording or capture a photo. The sample also  demonstrate how use the orientation sensors to cover the functions that most camera apps will require.

Specifically, this sample will cover how to:

1. **Manage the MediaCapture object** throughout the lifecycle of the app and through navigation events.
2. **Find camera location and the highest resolution**. Switch between Front and back camera.
3. **Start and stop the preview** to a UI element, including mirroring for front-facing cameras.
4. **Add Video Effects Contrast, Brightness, HueSaturation, Antique, Sepia, Blend and grayscale effects**
5. **Control the effects level** with a slider.
6. **Switch between different effects**
7. **Take a picture** to a file, and disable the video capture button if the app is running on a device that doesn't support concurrent capturing of photos and video.
8. **Record a video** to a file, and disable the photo capture button if the app is running on a device that doesn't support concurrent capturing of photos and video.
9. **Handle rotation events** for both, the device moving in space and the page orientation changing on the screen. Also apply any necessary corrections to the preview stream rotation and to captured photos and videos.
10. **Handle MediaCapture RecordLimitationExceeded and Failed events** to be notified that video recording needs to be stopped due to a video being too long, or clean up the MediaCapture instance when an error occurs.
11. Using MVVM to separate view from model.
